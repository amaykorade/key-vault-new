# GitHub-Style RBAC Implementation Summary

## ✅ **What We've Accomplished**

We've successfully implemented a complete GitHub-style RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) system for your Key Vault MVP!

---

## 📦 **1. Database Schema Updates**

### **New Models Added:**

```prisma
model ProjectMember {
  id        String      @id @default(uuid())
  projectId String
  userId    String
  role      ProjectRole @default(READ)
  
  @@unique([projectId, userId])
}

enum ProjectRole {
  OWNER  // Full control, can delete project
  ADMIN  // Can manage members and secrets
  WRITE  // Can create/edit secrets
  READ   // View only
}
```

✅ **Migration Applied:** `20251021101910_add_project_members`

---

## 🔐 **2. Access Control System**

### **New File:** `/Backend/src/services/access-control.ts`

**Key Features:**
- ✅ GitHub-style permission model
- ✅ Clear access hierarchy (Org OWNER/ADMIN → Project Member → No Access)
- ✅ Efficient permission checking
- ✅ Helper methods for all operations

**Access Priority:**
1. **Org OWNER/ADMIN** → Automatic full access to all projects
2. **Project Member** → Access based on project role
3. **No access** otherwise

**Permission Matrix:**

| Role | Read | Write | Delete | Manage Members | Delete Project |
|------|------|-------|--------|----------------|----------------|
| **Org OWNER** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Org ADMIN** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Project OWNER** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Project ADMIN** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **Project WRITE** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Project READ** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

---

## 🔧 **3. Backend Updates**

### **A. Secret Service** (`/Backend/src/services/secret.ts`)

✅ All secret operations now use proper access control:

```typescript
// Before (❌ Wrong):
const project = await db.project.findFirst({
  where: {
    organization: { memberships: { some: { userId } } }
  }
});

// After (✅ Correct):
const canWrite = await AccessControlService.canWrite(userId, projectId);
if (!canWrite) {
  throw new Error('Access denied: You need WRITE permission');
}
```

**Updated Methods:**
- ✅ `createSecret()` - Checks WRITE permission
- ✅ `getProjectSecrets()` - Checks READ permission
- ✅ `getSecretById()` - Checks READ permission
- ✅ `updateSecret()` - Checks WRITE permission
- ✅ `deleteSecret()` - Checks DELETE permission
- ✅ `getUserSecrets()` - Returns only accessible projects' secrets
- ✅ `searchSecrets()` - Searches only accessible projects

---

### **B. Project Service** (`/Backend/src/services/project.ts`)

✅ **Auto-Owner Assignment:**
```typescript
// When creating a project
await db.$transaction(async (tx) => {
  const project = await tx.project.create({ data });
  
  // Automatically add creator as OWNER
  await tx.projectMember.create({
    data: { projectId: project.id, userId, role: 'OWNER' }
  });
});
```

**Updated Methods:**
- ✅ `createProject()` - Auto-adds creator as OWNER
- ✅ `getOrganizationProjects()` - Returns only accessible projects
- ✅ `getProjectById()` - Includes userRole and userAccess
- ✅ `updateProject()` - Checks ADMIN/OWNER role
- ✅ `deleteProject()` - Checks OWNER role
- ✅ `getUserProjects()` - Uses AccessControlService

---

### **C. Project Member Service** (`/Backend/src/services/project-member.ts`) **[NEW!]**

Complete GitHub-style member management:

**Methods:**
- ✅ `addMember()` - Add user to project with role
- ✅ `updateMemberRole()` - Change member's role
- ✅ `removeMember()` - Remove member from project
- ✅ `getProjectMembers()` - List all project members
- ✅ `getAvailableMembers()` - Get org members not yet in project

**Smart Protections:**
- ✅ Can't remove last OWNER
- ✅ Can't demote last OWNER
- ✅ Only org members can be added
- ✅ Prevents duplicate memberships

---

### **D. Project Routes** (`/Backend/src/routes/projects.ts`)

✅ **New API Endpoints:**

```typescript
// Project Member Management
GET    /projects/:projectId/members              // List members
GET    /projects/:projectId/available-members    // Get addable users
POST   /projects/:projectId/members              // Add member
PUT    /projects/:projectId/members/:userId      // Update role
DELETE /projects/:projectId/members/:userId      // Remove member
```

---

## 🎨 **4. Frontend Updates**

### **A. Types** (`/frontend/src/types/index.ts`)

✅ Added new types:
```typescript
export type ProjectRole = 'OWNER' | 'ADMIN' | 'WRITE' | 'READ';

export interface ProjectMember {
  id: string;
  user: { id, name, email, image };
  role: ProjectRole;
  createdAt: string;
}

export interface AddProjectMemberRequest {
  userId: string;
  role: ProjectRole;
}
```

---

### **B. API Service** (`/frontend/src/services/api.ts`)

✅ **New Methods:**
```typescript
// Project Member Management
apiService.getProjectMembers(projectId)
apiService.getAvailableProjectMembers(projectId)
apiService.addProjectMember(projectId, data)
apiService.updateProjectMemberRole(projectId, userId, data)
apiService.removeProjectMember(projectId, userId)
```

---

### **C. Components Created**

#### **1. ShareProjectModal** (`/frontend/src/components/ShareProjectModal.tsx`) **[NEW!]**

Beautiful GitHub-style sharing modal:
- ✅ Search organization members
- ✅ Select role (OWNER/ADMIN/WRITE/READ)
- ✅ Visual role descriptions
- ✅ Only shows members not yet in project
- ✅ Responsive design

**Features:**
- 🔍 Real-time member search
- 🎨 Role cards with descriptions
- 📱 Mobile-friendly
- ⚡ Instant feedback

---

#### **2. ProjectMembersSection** (`/frontend/src/components/ProjectMembersSection.tsx`) **[NEW!]**

Complete member management UI:
- ✅ List all project members
- ✅ Show member avatars and info
- ✅ Role badges with icons (Crown, Shield, Edit, Eye)
- ✅ Inline role changing (dropdown menu)
- ✅ Remove members
- ✅ Shows "You" badge for current user

**Features:**
- 👥 Beautiful member cards
- 🎯 Quick role changes (like GitHub)
- 🛡️ Visual role hierarchy
- 🚫 Prevents last OWNER removal
- 🎨 Dark theme support

---

### **D. Pages Updated**

#### **ProjectDetailsPage** (`/frontend/src/pages/ProjectDetailsPage.tsx`)

✅ **New Sections Added:**
- 📊 Project Members Section (with member management)
- 🏢 Project Teams Section (optional, existing)

**Layout:**
```
1. Project Header
2. Environment Stats (Dev/Staging/Prod)
3. 👥 Project Members Section  ← NEW!
4. 🏢 Project Teams Section     ← Existing  
5. 🔍 Filters
6. 🔐 Secrets List
```

---

## 🚀 **How It Works Now**

### **User Flow:**

```
1. User creates Organization → Becomes ORG OWNER

2. User invites people to Org
   └── They become ORG MEMBER (no project access yet!)

3. User creates Project
   └── Automatically becomes PROJECT OWNER

4. User shares Project (GitHub-style) 🆕
   ├── Click "Add Member"
   ├── Search & select org member
   ├── Choose role (OWNER/ADMIN/WRITE/READ)
   └── Member gets access!

5. Member can now:
   ├── View secrets (if READ+)
   ├── Create/edit secrets (if WRITE+)
   ├── Delete secrets (if ADMIN+)
   ├── Manage members (if ADMIN+)
   └── Delete project (if OWNER)
```

---

## 📋 **Example Use Cases**

### **Example 1: Startup Team**
```
Organization: "Startup Inc"
├── Alice (Org OWNER)
├── Bob (Org MEMBER)
└── Charlie (Org MEMBER)

Project: "Production API Keys"
├── Alice (auto-OWNER via org)
├── Bob (added as WRITE) → Can add/edit secrets
└── Charlie (no access) → Can't see project

Project: "Internal Tools"
├── Alice (auto-OWNER via org)
└── Charlie (added as ADMIN) → Full control
```

### **Example 2: Agency with Clients**
```
Organization: "Dev Agency"
├── Admin (Org OWNER)
├── 5 Developers (Org MEMBER)
└── 2 Clients (Org VIEWER)

Project: "Client A - Production"
├── Admin (auto-OWNER)
├── Dev Team Lead (ADMIN)
├── 2 Backend Devs (WRITE)
├── 1 Frontend Dev (READ)
└── Client A (READ)

Project: "Internal Secrets"
├── Admin (auto-OWNER)
└── Dev Team Lead (ADMIN)
(Clients have no access)
```

GET    /api/projects/:projectId/available-members

DELETE /api/projects/:projectId/members/:userId
```

### **Example Requests:**

{
  "userId": "user-456",
  "role": "WRITE"
}
```

**Update Role:**

SELECT 
  gen_random_uuid(),
  p.id,
  m.userId,
  'OWNER'::ProjectRole,
  NOW(),

   - Like document sharing in Google Docs

3. **Team Quick-Add**
   - Add entire team to project at once
   - All team members get same role

4. **Access Requests**
   - Members can request access
   - Owners approve/deny

5. **Temporary Access**

   - Auto-revoke after expiry

6. **External Collaborators**
   - Non-org members
   - Project-only access

7. **Audit Logs**
