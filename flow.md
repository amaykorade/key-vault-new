1. Secrets Management (Core Feature)
This is the heart of your Key Vault - you need to implement:
Secrets model in Prisma schema (name, value, type, projectId, encrypted)
Encryption service (AES-256-GCM with envelope encryption)
Secrets CRUD API (create, read, update, delete secrets)
Access control (only project members can access secrets)

2. API Keys & Programmatic Access
API key generation for programmatic access
Rate limiting and usage tracking
SDK/CLI tools for developers to integrate


3. Frontend Dashboard
React frontend with modern UI (Ant Design as mentioned)
Organization/project management interface
Secrets management UI with proper security (masked values)
User management and role assignment

4. Security Enhancements
Audit logging (who accessed what, when)
Secret rotation capabilities
Environment-specific secrets (dev/staging/prod)
Secret sharing with expiration

5. Billing & Monetization
Stripe integration for per-seat billing
Usage tracking and limits
Subscription management
