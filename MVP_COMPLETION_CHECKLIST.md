## 🚧 **REMAINING FOR MVP**

### **1. Critical - Data Migration** ⚠️

**Run migration for existing projects:**

```bash
cd Backend
node migrate-existing-projects.js
```

This will:
- Add org OWNER/ADMIN as project OWNER for all existing projects
- Ensure existing projects have proper access control

**Estimated time:** 2 minutes

---

### **2. Testing & Bug Fixes** 🧪

**Test these scenarios:**

#### **A. Project Access Control:**
- [ ] Create project → Creator becomes OWNER
- [ ] Org OWNER can access all projects
- [ ] Org MEMBER cannot access unshared projects
- [ ] Add member with READ → Can only view
- [ ] Add member with WRITE → Can view/edit, not delete
- [ ] Add member with ADMIN → Can manage members + secrets
- [ ] Add member with OWNER → Full control

#### **B. Permission Enforcement:**
- [ ] READ role: Edit/Delete buttons hidden
- [ ] WRITE role: Delete button hidden
- [ ] READ role: Trying to edit shows error toast
- [ ] WRITE role: Trying to delete shows error toast
- [ ] "Add Secret" button hidden for READ role

#### **C. Member Management:**
- [ ] Can add members from org
- [ ] Can change member roles
- [ ] Can remove members
- [ ] Cannot remove last OWNER
- [ ] Cannot demote last OWNER
- [ ] Dropdown menu appears on top (z-index fix)

#### **D. Teams (Optional Feature):**
- [ ] Teams still work for bulk operations
- [ ] Team-project assignments still functional
- [ ] Teams don't interfere with direct project members

**Estimated time:** 30 minutes testing

---

### **3. UI/UX Polish** 🎨

**Minor improvements:**

- [ ] Show user's role badge on project page
- [ ] Add permission indicators/tooltips
- [ ] Loading states for all operations
- [ ] Empty state messages
- [ ] Confirmation dialogs

**Optional enhancements:**
- [ ] Show "No permission" message instead of hiding buttons
- [ ] Add role descriptions in UI
- [ ] Project settings page
- [ ] Bulk member operations

**Estimated time:** 1-2 hours

---

### **4. Documentation** 📝

**Update README with:**
- [ ] New RBAC model explanation
- [ ] How to share projects
- [ ] Permission levels guide
- [ ] Migration instructions for existing users

**Create user guide:**
- [ ] How to create and share projects
- [ ] Understanding roles (OWNER/ADMIN/WRITE/READ)
- [ ] Managing team members
- [ ] Best practices

**Estimated time:** 30 minutes

---

### **5. Edge Cases & Error Handling** 🐛

**Handle these scenarios:**

- [ ] User removed from org → Remove from all projects
- [ ] Project deleted → Clean up members
- [ ] Last OWNER leaves org → Handle gracefully
- [ ] Concurrent role updates
- [ ] Invalid user IDs
- [ ] Network errors

**Most are handled by Prisma CASCADE, but verify:**
```sql
-- Verify cascading deletes work
DELETE FROM "Organization" WHERE id = 'test-org';
-- Should cascade to: Projects → ProjectMembers → Secrets
```

**Estimated time:** 1 hour

---

### **6. Performance Optimization** ⚡ (Optional)

**Current implementation is good for MVP, but consider:**

- [ ] Cache access checks (reduce DB queries)
- [ ] Batch permission checks
- [ ] Index optimization
- [ ] Query optimization for large teams

**For later:** This is not critical for MVP

---

### **7. Security Audit** 🔒

**Verify:**
- [ ] No direct secret access without permission checks
- [ ] All routes properly protected
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] SQL injection prevention (Prisma handles this)
- [ ] XSS prevention (React handles this)
- [ ] CSRF protection (if needed)

**Estimated time:** 30 minutes review

---

## 📋 **Quick Start Tasks (Next 30 mins)**

### **Priority 1: Must Do**
1. **Run migration script** (2 mins)
   ```bash
   cd Backend

   ```

2. **Test basic flow** (10 mins)
   - Create project
   - Add member with READ role
   - Login as that member
   - Verify they can't edit/delete

3. **Fix critical bugs** (if any found)

### **Priority 2: Should Do**
4. **Test all role combinations** (15 mins)
5. **Verify error messages** (5 mins)
6. **Check dropdown menu z-index** (2 mins)

### **Priority 3: Nice to Have**
7. **Add role badge to project header**
8. **Improve empty states**
9. **Add tooltips**
